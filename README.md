# SecondLamp

A project started at the [Make.Opendata 2014 Hackathon in Basel, Switzerland](http://make.opendata.ch/) with the goal to work with the [data](http://datahub.io/dataset/magglingen2013) provided by the [LPM system](http://www.baspo.admin.ch/internet/baspo/de/home/themen/forschung/forschung_nach_themen/Local_Positioning_Measurement_System_LPMS.html) developed and operated by the Federal Office of Sport. On one side the team wanted to find new patterns in the data that indicate interesting facts that could be useful for coaches. On the other side the team wanted to built something on top of existing data.
This lead to [#SecondLamp](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23SecondLamp), which aims to be a visual indicator for how interesting a current game situation is. It takes into account the pressure on the ball and the proximity to the goal and translates it into a brightness level of a [Hue lamp](http://meethue.com/).
